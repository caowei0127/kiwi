Background-Problem-Statements: 
    <p align="left">
        This project simulates a real-life IT working environment and has us test our strengths in working closely as a project team. The project is basically about developing web and mobile based platforms to implement university courses distribution, selection and management procedures for users including students, instructors and administrators. Our team have applied the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt on this project.

Implementations-Outcomes:
    <p align="left">User Requirements Analysis </p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Interviewed with stokeholds and understood their BAU and pain points.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Generated user requirement statements and converted into business cases with 100% conversion rate
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p align="left">Initial Design</p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Decomposed the software into module levels according to certain principles, assigned certain tasks to each module, and determined the relationships and interfaces between modules.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p align="left">Detailed Design</p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Designed detailed processes and algorithms inside each module, making it accurate and structured.
            When possible changes needed to be made to the structure, we returned to the initial design stage and reflected back correspondingly. 
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Generated one documentation for each module, including module overview, interface design and data structure, as well as process logic design.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p align="left">Coding</p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Tools include ASP.NET and Microsoft SQL server.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Implemented based on our detailed design by ensuring log feedback system, handling exceptions and avoiding complex logic.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Conducted peer code review on a daily basis to track progress and solved problems as a team, as well as consolidating codes on GitHub.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Created unit tests, having captured potential bugs effectively.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p align="left">Delivery</p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Fulfilled 100% requirements in the detailed design.
            </li>
        </ul>
